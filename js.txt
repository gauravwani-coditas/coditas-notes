JavaScript

1.Intro
    1. JavaScript is Dynamically , loosely bound scripting language
    2. Dynamically = we don’t need to define data type of variables, it defines at runtime .
    3. Loosely = we can have operations on elements of different data types (addition, subtraction,etc) unlike static languages like c,c++,java, etc
    4. Scripting language which does not have main function and render

Functionalities : 

 	1) It adds functionality to web pages.
	2) Object oriented
	3) Event driven
	4)Asynchronous - It helps UI run peacefully while fetching response from server.
    

Datatypes in javaScript : 

1. Primitive :
    1. Number 
    2. String
    3. Boolean
    4. Undefined (Not defined are not defined and undefined are not assigned)
    5. Null
    6. Symbol
    7. Bigint
2. Non-primitive:
    1. Array
    2. Functions

Strings: strings in js are immutable

	string to int can also be done using + operator
	using parseInt()
	using numbe()

	charAt()
	charCodeAt() give ascii value of character

	difference between toLowerCase() and tolocalLowerCase()
	substr(a,b) : a - starting index and b - no. of characters.
	trim(), trimStart(), trimEnd()
	
False values : 
0
‘’
Null 
Undefined
NaN
False

Array properties

Arr.length

Array methods: 
arr.push()
arr.pop();
arr.shift()
arr.unshift()
arr.slice(si,ei+1);
arr.splice(si, ei, add1,add2);
arr.sort();

arr.sort(compareFunction(a,b){
	Return a.length-b.length}
)


arr.toString() //it will convert array to string
It is used to compare exactly same arrays .

Array.isArray() //used to identify whether it is array.

Destructuring is used to access keys of objects rather than . Or [‘key’];

JS is single theaded language.

Promise -> pending,resolve,reject.

Promise : used to async operations 
1. Promise is a class and we create object of that class and return Promise supports response, reject operations. It holds parameters which
