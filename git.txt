//To add repo on GitHub :
//git branch -M main :  (move branch to main)
	=> git branch : show git command related to branch
	=> -M : move operation
	=> main : main branch

//git remote add origin “git_urL” : (adds new remote named origin url
	=>git remote : git command related to remote repos
	=>add origin ‘git_url; : adds new remote_url to our git name origin

//git push -u origin main

Fast forward merge in git : 
Fast forward merge in git provide linear history of commits 
We made one branch in our main repo 
We made many commits in our branch and there is no other branch in our main 
When we rebase our branch Over main our branch is fast forwarded and merged.
